# CHOMP

CHOMP is a retro shark maze arcade game foundation built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player will eventually control a cartoon shark through coral reef tunnels, collecting chum and avoiding ocean defenders.

## Current Build

- Clean browser page with a centered HTML Canvas.
- Start screen with title, subtitle, objective text, and start prompt.
- Spacebar, click, or tap input to switch into the playing screen.
- Tile-based maze rendered on the canvas.
- No external libraries.

## Maze Grid

The maze is stored in `script.js` as a 2D array. Each number represents one tile:

- `0` wall: coral reef or underwater rock block.
- `1` path: open dark-blue water.
- `2` chum: small red/pink collectible dot.
- `3` frenzy bait: larger glowing orange/red collectible.
- `4` empty: open water with no collectible.

The canvas uses 32-pixel tiles, with 19 columns and 15 rows. That creates an internal canvas size of 608 by 480 pixels.

## Run Locally

Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step or local server is required.

To test the start screen:

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Confirm the CHOMP start screen is visible.
3. Press Space, click the canvas, or tap the canvas.
4. Confirm the maze appears.
